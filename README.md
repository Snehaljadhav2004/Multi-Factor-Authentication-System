# Multi-Factor-Authentication-System
The aim of the "Multi-Factor Authentication System" project is to build a security application that enhances user account protection by requiring multiple forms of verification. This system ensures that users authenticate their identity using a combination of something they know (password), something they have (mobile device), and something they are (biometrics). The main goal is to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access by implementing a robust, layered authentication process. The project focuses on improving online security through an easy-to-use, reliable multi-factor authentication system that provides strong protection for user accounts.
